/**
  * HiQ Puzzle.
  * This program solves a very difficult classic solitaire puzzle where you jump pegs to remove them in a cross
  * shaped peg-board. The fewer pegs you have remaining at the end, the better. A perfect solution is to have only
  * one peg in the center square at the end.
  * Assuming an average of 7 different options on each move, there are
  * 7 &#94; 32 = 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
  * (10 decillion combinations)
  * Actually this calculation is not correct since many paths lead to the same board positions.
  * There are actually only 23.4 million unique board positions
  * see http://www.durangobill.com/Peg33.html for analysis.
  * A brute force solution will run for years on today's fastest computers.
  * See http://homepage.sunrise.ch/homepage/pglaus/Solitaire/solitaire.htm
  * for a solution that uses a genetic algorithm to find a solution quickly.
  *
  * My initial approach was to apply a kind of tunnel method.
  * I tried to solve the problem from both ends.
  * First, I work backwards for 32-FORWARD_MOVE's and build a hashmap of all the possible board positions - storing
  * a path to the solution at each hashmap location. Then I traverse forward from the initial position
  * for BACK_MOVE's until I reach one of these positions that I know leads to the solution.
  * Then I combined the 2 paths to see the sequence that will lead to the solution.
  * Finally, I found that it was enough to search entirely from the beginning
  * and just prune when I reach states I've encountered before.
  * When I first ran this successfully, it took about 1 hour to run on an AMD 64bit 3200.
  * After optimization it  ran in about 3 minutes on a Core2Duo (189 seconds).
  * After parallelizing the algorithm using ConcurrentPuzzleSolver it is down to 93 seconds on the CoreDuo.
  * Using A* search, concurrency, and further optimization and running on a Skylake 4 core - it takes about 10 seconds.
